# Anomandaris

Rewriting `make` in Rust as a learning exercise.


## Why "Anomandaris?"

I wanted to name the project something akin to "make," but indicating it was written in Rust.
Rake?
That already existed.
So, with that name reminding me of the character from Stephen Erikson's *"Malazan Book of the Fallen,"* I named the project *"Anomandaris."*
